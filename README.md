# SNES Cream Demo

In the early 90s, Tao (Mr. Frank Seemann), Candyman (Ultra) and i did some half-arsed coding on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).  The result can be found here... Un-edited, not a bit debugged and in the form it was originally published.
From what i can gather, it was first published in 09/1994 on a BBS called ZOMB's Musicbox.

I can't get the cross assembler to work for the time being, maybe DOS BOX would do the trick.. but i can't be bothered :) 

For obvious reasons, i cannot include the binary music data.
